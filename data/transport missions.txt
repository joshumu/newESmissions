			`	You approach some of the people at the end of the line and ask what's going on. "It's the last day of Adelita's exposition on the evacuation of Hope," says an excited young woman. "It was their first work that really got them famous. The last week of their expositions are always free. This is a great chance to see it if you haven't already."`
			`	The line seems to be moving pretty quickly.`
			choice
				`	"Sure, why not."`
				` 	"Maybe some other time."`
					defer
			`	"You're going to love it," she says. "No one knows who they really are but Adelita's work is what inspired me to study Journalism. Their mixture of mediums, their eye for story telling... I just love it. I have seen a lot of their stuff but never this expo on Hope. I'm so excited!"`
			`	You tell her about your visit to Hope helping the scientists but you reach the entrance to the "expo" before you get a chance to finish.`
			`	"That story is going to make this exhibit what much more interesting. Thanks! You will have to tell me the end later. My name is Annie by the way. I "Hope" you enjoy the exposition," she giggles and skips off into the hanger. Follow soon after.`
			`	Inside is a large room filled with photos, videos, interviews and other mixed media. They focus on three groups: the refugees of Hope, the Navy that saved them, and the Paradise planets that protested the evacuation. There is an installation with nearly a hundred original protest signs from rallies against the Dirt Belt and Navy. Some of them are quite crude and tasteless. Since you are on a Paradise planet it's a strong rebuke. There are many, many photos but one especially catches your eye. It's of a woman standing in line to board a Navy destroyer. She is holding a baby at her hip and staring at the camera with a look of sad determination. Their cheeks, rosy and chapped, stand out in contrast with the cold blues in the background. It gives you goosebumps.`
			`	While good, you were hoping for a bit more as you head for the exit. As the automatic doors open you are hit with an unexpected arctic blast. Instead of back in the spaceport you find yourself in a life sized 3D recording of the evacuation of Hope, complete with refrigeration. Annie, now in a winter coat, is nearly rolling with laughter. "You sure took your time. But the look on your face was worth it. Grab a coat from the rack," she says pointing.`
			`	The projection gives the illusion of a horizon. There are huge Navy destroyers slowly collecting ash in a snowy field near a small town as hundreds of refugees slowly board. But what stands out most is the giant volcano erupting in the background.`
			`	"It's more of a collage than an exact rendering," says Annie. "They took 3D recordings from different moments and areas of Hope and edited them together in various loops.  The volcano was actually on the other side of the planet for example. The magic of editing. So what do you think?"`
			choice
				`   "I'm impressed"`
			`    "I know, right? Well, I have to get home and study for an exam. You better go see what you can, the exhibit closes soon," she says before walking to the exit.`
			`	You wander around the exhibit in awe. It's a bit disconcerting as the occasional hologram walks through you. Inside houses you see families frantically gathering their belongings and running for the Navy ships. It strikes you that somewhere here is a young Katya leaving her doomed home. You walk down one of the lines of refugees, observing each person. An officer slips in the snow and a young man helps him up.`
			`	As you move on you're startled to realize your face to face with the woman holding the baby, right where they were in the photo. She is bouncing the baby on her hip while advancing in little steps toward the ship. A young woman with a camera and a respirator covering her face walks up to her, asks a question and begins to take photos. Before you can register whats going on the entire projection disappears in a disorienting flash, leaving you in a normal hanger bay. You are a little embarrassed to realize the exhibit is nearly empty as a woman walks up to you. "She loves that moment too. That's probably why she fought so hard to have that part left in, even though its a security risk."`
			`	"How rude of me," she says. "My name is Mariel, I organize these expositions and act as a spokesperson so the members of Adelita can remain anonymous. And you are?"`
			`	"Captain <first> <last>."`
			`	"Captain," she says, her eyes lighting up. "Well, as you may know this is the last day of the expo. The captain that I hired to transport all the installations back to <destination> is not only rude but now late. I would much rather have it in the hands of someone who appreciates the work. I was going to pay him 60000, but will pay you 80000 to do it now. What do you say?"`

Maybe you have the hope of being one some day; wealthy, authoritative. Or maybe you just don't care. Either way, you don't sound like a good fit for this project.

			`It's not hard to find a remote canyon within drone range of the target area. You stay hovering in case you need a quick escape but are well inside the atmosphere so Bunker releases the drones from the open cargo bay without a pressure suit. They are so small you can't make them out from the cockpit, nor can you see them on your ships scanners. When Bunker returns he sets up a mini-3D display and sits at the controller. "OK, they are on auto-pilot to the rendezvous site."`
			`	Once the drones are on site you can see a lone syndicate ship with a security detail posted in front of the loading ramp. "The pirates must be late," says Bunker, smirking. "Typical. I'm going to scatter the drones and set a proximity alert."`
			`	"You know, there's a part of me that would much rather be liberating slaves instead of filming them," he says after a moment of silence.

			`	"Show time," he says rubbing his hands together. You both watch as a pirate capital ship lands near the security detail, probably deafening them. It's accompanied by a small fleet of small escorts. As soon as the loading ramp is down the security detail gets to work herding the slaves from one ship to another. You see them hit and shove any man, woman or child that moves to slowly for their liking. It's hard to watch.`
			`	"Pigs," he blurts out while zooming in and out of different areas. "What do we have here," he says, zooming in on two men talking a few meters away from everyone else. One is in a suit, the other a black hooded robe. "Must be the leaders," he whispers, as if they can hear him. Just then, the hooded man you assume is the pirate leader looks up to the sky, as if he sees something. The pirate says something into his comm and his escorts fire up their engines and begin taking off. "I don't like the look of this," says Bunker."`

There is a large factory with its forth wall removed so you can see inside. There are hundreds of people running a plethora of machines. Armed guards patrol the slaves and public beatings are doled out seemingly at random to motivate the rest. Your contribution to the project is front in center. A stream of slaves passes from the pirate ship to the Syndicate ship. It's much more visceral in life size than the little projector Bunker had. As a guard brings down a baton on a woman's head you find yourself trying to stop him, only to stumble through the hologram. Your heart is pounding.`

Even though you were out gunned and didn't have a choice, you still find yourself deeply regretting not trying to help these people. You see Ale is crying and Bunker is already taking to Mariel about changes.`
