			`You find Ale and Bunker in the 'Common Ground Cafe' chatting with a young man in his mid-twenties. You notice they have backpacks and some cases with them. "There you are," says Bunker. "I was just telling them how you handled those pirate slavers."`
			`	"For like the hundredth time," says Ale, rolling her eyes.`
			`	"That's because it was epic. Aside from the thought of that pirate sensing the drones. If that's even what happened. It still gives me the chills.`
			choice
				`	"I haven't slept well since that day."`
				`	"I think it was just a coincidence."`
			`	"Whatever it was, it was weird. Ah, remember when we talked about liberating slave instead of filming them. Well this is Beto," he says, now more quietly.`
			`	"It's a pleasure to meet you Captain <last>," says Beto in a thick accent. "We have heard you played no small part in the recent independence of the Man system. This is exactly what we want too. But unfortunately the Republic is not as flexible as the Free Worlds, they would never help us."`
			`	"You see Beto here works with a group on Freedom," says Bunker. "They want to liberate their planet from the pirates and return to the ways of their ancestors; a system of autonomous assemblies and unions cooperating in mutual aid. You can say we support their work and they support ours. They recently made quite the stir on Freedom with a daylight raid on a slave market."`
			choice
				`	"You attacked the pirates on their own planet?"`

			`	"It's not their planet," exclaims Beto. "And were forced into action. They kidnapped and were about to sell some of our comrades as retribution for our activism. It was our first act of armed struggle. Until this point we have mostly been focused on opening a collectively owned and managed factory to provide options other than piracy or wage slavery. We had just inaugurated the first section of the factory when the slavers attacked."`
			`	"You see, half of my home town has been controlled by pirates since before I was born. The anti-slavery assemblies of West Mesa have maintained a tenuous peace with the pro-slavery pirates occupying East Mesa, but our efforts are raising tensions faster then anticipated. Even though we managed to liberate not only our comrades but all the slaves for sale that day, we have been woefully unprepared for the pirate reaction. In the last weeks a number of our comrades have been disappeared. Many in the movement have gone underground. We need guns, ships, equipment and most of all allies if we are to stand a chance of achieving our goals."`
			`	"That's where we come in," says Ale. "`

			`	"While their daring raid has brought them the ire of the pirates it has also gained them support in some unlikely places. We want to amplify that by going up to Freedom to interview fighters and freed slaves for an exposition. Of course they will be more likely to participate in the project if we help them, which is something we want to do anyways. So what we need from you is to pick up some supplies from near here and take it all to Freedom, along with us. Oh, and there will almost definitely be combat involved," she says with an innocent smile. "I really shouldn't tell you more until you accept."`

"They have a long list a gripes including paying a high cut of the profits for nearly zero representation nor protection from pirates. The higher ups are being pushed by a radical factory union. They are our contacts. It's the only union with any real power in all of Syndicate space. But they are pretty isolated out here on the fringes and far outgunned. We still don't understand all of their motivations, which worries me. But they are offering to provide factory equipment, and some level of armament to defend from the pirate attacks."`
			`	"I'm sure they will take their time," she says after a moment. "I'm going to explore for awhile. Let's meet up in the spaceport in a few hours."`
