			`As you explore the luxurious spaceport you notice a large group of people around one of the larger hangers.`
			choice
				`	(Check it out.)`
				`	(Not right now.)`
					defer
			`	You approach some of the people at the end of the line and ask what's going on. "It's the last day of Adelita's exposition on the evacuation of Hope," says an excited young woman. "It was their first work that really got them famous. The last week of their expositions are always free. This is a great chance to see it if you haven't already."`
			`	The line seems to be moving pretty quickly.`
			choice
				`	"Sure, why not."`
				` 	"Maybe some other time."`
					defer
			`	"You're going to love it," she says. "No one knows who they really are but Adelita's work is what inspired me to study Journalism. Their mixture of mediums, their eye for story telling... I just love it. I have seen a lot of their stuff but never this expo on Hope. I'm so excited!"`
			`	You tell her about your visit to Hope helping the scientists but you reach the entrance to the "expo" before you get a chance to finish.`
			`	"That story is going to make this exhibit what much more interesting. Thanks! You will have to tell me the end later. My name is Annie by the way. I "Hope" you enjoy the exposition," she giggles and skips off into the hanger. Follow soon after.`
			`	Inside is a large room filled with photos, videos, interviews and other mixed media. They focus on three groups: the refugees of Hope, the Navy that saved them, and the Paradise planets that protested the evacuation. There is an installation with nearly a hundred original protest signs from rallies against the Dirt Belt and Navy. Some of them are quite crude and tasteless. Since you are on a Paradise planet it's a strong rebuke. There are many, many photos but one especially catches your eye. It's of a woman standing in line to board a Navy destroyer. She is holding a baby at her hip and staring at the camera with a look of sad determination. Their cheeks, rosy and chapped, stand out in contrast with the cold blues in the background. It gives you goosebumps.`
			`	While good, you were hoping for a bit more as you head for the exit. As the automatic doors open you are hit with an unexpected arctic blast. Instead of back in the spaceport you find yourself in a life sized 3D recording of the evacuation of Hope, complete with refrigeration. Annie, now in a winter coat, is nearly rolling with laughter. "You sure took your time. But the look on your face was worth it. Grab a coat from the rack," she says pointing.`
			`	The projection gives the illusion of a horizon. There are huge Navy destroyers slowly collecting ash in a snowy field near a small town as hundreds of refugees slowly board. But what stands out most is the giant volcano erupting in the background.`
			`	"It's more of a collage than an exact rendering," says Annie. "They took 3D recordings from different moments and areas of Hope and edited them together in various loops.  The volcano was actually on the other side of the planet for example. The magic of editing. So what do you think?"`
			choice
				`   "I'm impressed"`
			`    "I know, right? Well, I have to get home and study for an exam. You better go see what you can, the exhibit closes soon," she says before walking to the exit.`
			`	You wander around the exhibit in awe. It's a bit disconcerting as the occasional hologram walks through you. Inside houses you see families frantically gathering their belongings and running for the Navy ships. It strikes you that somewhere here is a young Katya leaving her doomed home. You walk down one of the lines of refugees, observing each person. An officer slips in the snow and a young man helps him up.`
			`	As you move on you're startled to realize your face to face with the woman holding the baby, right where they were in the photo. She is bouncing the baby on her hip while advancing in little steps toward the ship. A young woman with a camera and a respirator covering her face walks up to her, asks a question and begins to take photos. Before you can register whats going on the entire projection disappears in a disorienting flash, leaving you in a normal hanger bay. You are a little embarrassed to realize the exhibit is nearly empty as a woman walks up to you. "She loves that moment too. That's probably why she fought so hard to have that part left in, even though its a security risk."`
			`	"How rude of me," she says. "My name is Mariel, I organize these expositions and act as a spokesperson so the members of Adelita can remain anonymous. And you are?"`
			`	"Captain <first> <last>."`
			`	"Captain," she says, her eyes lighting up. "Well, as you may know this is the last day of the expo. The captain that I hired to transport all the installations back to <destination> is not only rude but now late. I would much rather have it in the hands of someone who appreciates the work. I was going to pay him 60000, but will pay you 80000 to do it now. What do you say?"`
			choice
				`	"I would love to."`
				`	"Why not."`

Before your meal arrives a woman, maybe in her late thirties with dark hair, sits down across from you and hails the server. She cheerfully orders a smoothie with a long list of ingredients, many of which you have never heard of, or can even pronounce.`

And the same goes for every single act of oppression and liberation since the dawn of humanity. Our oppressors are very political. Maybe you have the hope of being one some day; wealthy, authoritative. Or maybe you just don't care. Either way, you don't sound like a good fit for this project. But thanks for transporting the installation," she says with a smile. She gets her smoothie to-go and walks out.`

			`	Mariel said you saw me take the photos of the woman and her baby," you are surprised by the bluntness of her admission. "I really like that moment. Not many notice it. Your observant. Hopefully your kind too. We need a ship for our next project. We need you to transport a team to one planet, do a quick flyby of another, pickup the team and return here with everyone safe and sound. Nothing to dicey. But it's a dangerous universe, so who knows. Oh, and we have to leave today. I can't tell you more until you accept. It will pay, of course. 200000 credits. So what do ya say?

Here's the plan: you're going to drop me and two others off at Maker where we are going to film in 3D the conditions in a secrete Syndicate sweatshop. Thing is these aren't just poorly paid factory workers, but slaves. As you can imagine we can't get in as regular workers so with a bit of hacking we got ourselves jobs on site as private security. We know the Syndicate is getting the slaves from the pirates on Covert, and we also know where they do the transaction. So while we are getting the footage we need in the factories you and Bunker will spy on the Syndicate's rendezvous with the pirates on Hippocrates."`
			`    "Don't worry," she reassures you, sensing your concern about spying on pirates and the Syndicate. "Bunker is a pro and we have an array of long range stealth drones that do the spying, you won't be anywhere near them. But pirates do frequent the system so be quick."`
			`	See waves to the server for the bill as she finishes the last gulp of her smoothie. "Let's go. Everyone will be meeting at the hanger shortly."`

			`It's not hard to find a remote canyon within drone range of the target area. You stay hovering in case you need a quick escape but are well inside the atmosphere so Bunker releases the drones from the open cargo bay without a pressure suit. They are so small you can't make them out from the cockpit, nor can you see them on your ships scanners. When Bunker returns he sets up a mini-3D display and sits at the controller. "OK, they are on auto-pilot to the rendezvous site."`
			`	Once the drones are on site you can see a lone syndicate ship with a security detail posted in front of the loading ramp. "The pirates must be late," says Bunker, smirking. "Typical. I'm going to scatter the drones and set a proximity alert."`
			`	"You know, there's a part of me that would much rather be liberating slaves instead of filming them," he says after a moment of silence. "But for now it seems like this is the best way for me to help. Say we did liberate them right now. There is just going to be another slave ship tomorrow. But if we create political and social will; that could stop the slave ships forever."`

					goto showtime
			label showtime
			`	"Show time," he says rubbing his hands together. You both watch as a pirate capital ship lands near the security detail, probably deafening them. It's accompanied by a small fleet of small escorts. As soon as the loading ramp is down the security detail gets to work herding the slaves from one ship to another. You see them hit and shove any man, woman or child that moves to slowly for their liking. It's hard to watch.`
			`	"Pigs," he blurts out while zooming in and out of different areas. "What do we have here," he says, zooming in on two men talking a few meters away from everyone else. One is in a suit, the other a black hooded robe. "Must be the leaders," he whispers, as if they can hear him. Just then, the hooded man you assume is the pirate leader looks up to the sky, as if he sees something. The pirate says something into his comm and his escorts fire up their engines and begin taking off. "I don't like the look of this," says Bunker."`

			`	"You're the captain," he responds giving up. You continue to watch the display. The last of the slaves are loaded followed by the security team. The two men are last to get to their ships. You notice a slight hum from outside before getting raked with fire from one of the pirate escorts. You try pull out to space but another escort appears, cutting you off and laying down a stream of fire. Your engines are hit and your ship falls from the sky, exploding on impact.`

			`	"It's a pleasure to meet you Captain <last>," says Beto in a thick accent. "We have heard you played no small part in the recent independence of the Man system. This is exactly what we want too. But unfortunately the Republic is not as flexible as the Free Worlds, they would never help us."`
			`	"You see Beto here works with a group on Freedom," says Bunker. "They want to liberate their planet from the pirates and return to the ways of their ancestors; a system of autonomous assemblies and unions cooperating in mutual aid. You can say we support their work and they support ours. They recently made quite the stir on Freedom with a daylight raid on a slave market."`
			choice
				`	"You attacked the pirates on their own planet?"`

			`	"It's not their planet," exclaims Beto. "And were forced into action. They kidnapped and were about to sell some of our comrades as retribution for our activism. It was our first act of armed struggle. Until this point we have mostly been focused on opening a collectively owned and managed factory to provide options other than piracy or wage slavery. We had just inaugurated the first section of the factory when the slavers attacked."`
			`	"You see, half of my home town has been controlled by pirates since before I was born. The anti-slavery assemblies of West Mesa have maintained a tenuous peace with the pro-slavery pirates occupying East Mesa, but our efforts are raising tensions faster then anticipated. Even though we managed to liberate not only our comrades but all the slaves for sale that day, we have been woefully unprepared for the pirate reaction. In the last weeks a number of our comrades have been disappeared. Many in the movement have gone underground. We need guns, ships, equipment and most of all allies if we are to stand a chance of achieving our goals."`

We want to amplify that by going up to Freedom to interview fighters and freed slaves for an exposition.

So what we need from you is to pick up some supplies from near here and take it all to Freedom, along with us.

They are our contacts. It's the only union with any real power in all of Syndicate space. But they are pretty isolated out here on the fringes and far outgunned.
